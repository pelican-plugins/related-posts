Related Posts: A Plugin for Pelican
===================================

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/pelican-plugins/related-posts/main.yml?branch=main)](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/related-posts/actions) [![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pelican-related-posts)](https://pypi.org/project/pelican-related-posts/)

Related Posts is a Pelican plugin that adds a list of related posts to an article by adding a `related_posts` variable to the article’s context.


Installation
------------

This plugin can be installed via:

    python -m pip install pelican-related-posts


Usage
-----

By default, up to five related articles are listed. You can customize this value by defining `RELATED_POSTS_MAX` in your settings file:

    RELATED_POSTS_MAX = 10

You can then use the `article.related_posts` variable in your templates. For example:

    {% if article.related_posts %}
        <ul>
        {% for related_post in article.related_posts %}
            <li><a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ related_post.url }}">{{ related_post.title }}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% endif %}

Your related posts should share a common tag. You can also use `related_posts:` in your post’s meta-data. The `related_posts:` meta-data works together with your existing slugs:

    related_posts: slug1, slug2, slug3, ... slugN

`N` represents the `RELATED_POSTS_MAX` value.

Additionally, you can specify the following in your settings file:

    RELATED_POSTS_SKIP_SAME_CATEGORY = True

With this setting, `article.related_posts` will contain only related posts from categories other than the original article's.
